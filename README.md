# Translation Transformer: English to French

🚀 Neural Machine Translation (NMT) Model**

Welcome to my advanced **Translation Transformer**, an English-to-French neural machine translation model built using cutting-edge deep learning techniques. This project demonstrates expertise in **natural language processing (NLP)**, **sequence-to-sequence models**, and **attention mechanisms**, making it a showcase of advanced **machine learning** skills.

## 🔥 Features
- **Transformer Architecture**: Implements a self-attention mechanism for contextual understanding.
- **Pretrained Embeddings**: Uses word embeddings to enhance translation quality.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Covers data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily adaptable to different language pairs.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- **Python** 
- **PyTorch
- **Hugging Face Transformers** 

## 📊 Model Training & Evaluation
- **Dataset**: Trained on bilingual text corpora (e.g., WMT, OPUS).
- **Optimizer**: Adam with warm-up and learning rate scheduling.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: BLEU score for translation accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Batch size, attention heads, and hidden dimensions optimized for performance.
